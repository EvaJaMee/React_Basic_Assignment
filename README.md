NOTE FOR MENTOR REVIEWING: Feedback can be done in English and/or Dutch! No preference!

Additional notes/to be fixed in the future:
- Left out Health Labels color as it makes things a bit too cluttered with different colors in the current layout. 
This can be solved by redoing the layout and moving things around, but due to time-restraints, this will not be done this time.
- Radio Button dot doesn't show when choosing an option. I probably forgot something in the code, need to do an additional component or it's a bug. 
Radio button function works as required otherwise.
- Images are not all properly scaled. This can be fixed manually by making vertical images horizontal scaled, or in code in the future.
- Responsive layout for mobile view can be improved, looks odd at some places on very small sizes but is functional otherwise.

Recipe URL notes:
- Green coconut curry with salmon URL no longer works, so can't check the total cooking time. Leaving it at 0.
- Cajun Pork Pinwheels URL no longer works, so can't check the total cooking time. Leaving it at 0.
- Cooking times were set to 0 in the data.json. Manually checked each recipe and updated the data so that it shows properly in the information shown on the app.
- Swedish Pancakes has no total cooking time on the URL, putting it at approximately 15 mins in the data.json.
