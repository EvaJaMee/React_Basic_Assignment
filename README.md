NOTE FOR MENTOR REVIEWING: Feedback can be done in English and/or Dutch! No preference!

Updates and fixes:
- RadioButton fixed, had no dot showing when selected previously.
- Images scaling properly using objectFit="cover" in RecipeItem.jsx.
- Updated responsiveness.
- DOM error fixed in RecipeChoice and Ingredients.
- Updated package.json to add react-uuid and react-icons.

To be done in future:
- Fix the Diet Label, Cautions, Nutrients, Health Label placements and margins.
- Replace if-statement with switch-statement for recipeFilter function in SearchRecipe.jsx.
- Boxes of recipes blend a bit too well, adjust to create a better distinction.
- Add margin to the bottom of the page and the recipes on the homepage.
- Add a text showing "No recipes could be found" on the homepage when no results are found using the search bar.
- Adjust/add a color for Health Labels. Left it out for now to avoid too much color cluttering.
